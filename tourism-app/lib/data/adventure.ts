It is famous for the 'Sri Pada' (sacred footprint), a rock formation near the summit that is revered by four major religions. The climb is a rite of passage for many Sri Lankans and a profound experience for travelers.",

Reaching the summit at dawn to witness the 'Shadow of the Peak' cast across the clouds is a moment of pure magic.",
